      <p>My name is <strong>Nicol√°s Uriel Navall</strong>, and I
      am an Argentinian Computer Science Master's graduate who loves to
      express creatively through code.</p>
      
      <p>I like to work on interesting and challenging problems
      and reach simple and elegant solutions. I enjoy working on projects that I
      (and hopefully others) find helpful, especially if none has aimed to do something similar yet.</p>

      <p>I like to use programming as a creative outlet with projects and learn in the process.
      I consider myself a versatile developer, open to learning the necessary tools to achieve my goals,
      as well as sharing my enthusiasm about them and trying to teach what I learned <a href="../blog/">on my blog</a>.<p>
      
      My interests vary from modding, math, and machine learning to
      software engineering, game design, and the gaming industry as a whole;
      and, as you may probably notice with this site, virtual photography and writing in general.</p>

      <p>You can check out some of the projects I have been working on in my <a href="https://github.com/originalnicodr">Github</a>, and the game projects I have been
      involved in on <a href="https://itch.io/profile/originalnicodr">itch.io</a> (all of which are also linked in the <a href="../projects/">projects section</a>). I also tend
      to collaborate on the <a href="https://framedsc.com/">Framed site</a> by writing guides,
      doing maintenance, and more.</p>

      <p>If you have a question about any of my projects, are interested in collaborating, or simply want to chat, please don't hesitate to reach out <a href="mailto:niconavall@gmail.com">via email</a>.</p>
